Gitscraper examines PHP files to create SecList / Dictionary files which can be used against any environment ( not just PHP ) for pentesting & bounty hunters.

It will collect the following:

1) Folder & File Names

2) GET & POST variables

3) HTTP Header Variables

4) Laravel GET,POST,PUT & DELETE Routes

Each time one of the above is found it is added into its appropriate file in the /raw directory. These raw files are then sorted and ordered by the most duplicated content at the top and then cleaned as best as possible and put in the /cleaned directory

Current command for cleaning files ( to be run in /raw directory )

for filename in *; do sort $filename | grep -v ' ' | grep -v -P "\t" | uniq -d -c | sort -n -r | cut -c 9- > ../cleaned/$filename  ; done

1. ( sort ) Sort the file so all occurences are next to each other
2. ( grep ) Remove lines that contain spaces
3. ( grep ) Remove lines that contain tabs
4. ( uniq ) Pick out all the uniqe lines and prepend with the number of times found
5. ( sort ) Sort by the instance of times found to the most common is at the top
